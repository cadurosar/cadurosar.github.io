## Currently ##

PHD Student at IMT Atlantique, with the theme "Graphs for Deep Learning Latent Representations", under the supervision of [Vincent Gripon](http://www.vincent-gripon.com/) and [Michel Jezequel](http://perso.telecom-bretagne.eu/micheljezequel/). The Ph.D. program in the intersection of Graph Signal Processing (GSP) and Machine Learning. The main goal is to better understand the intermediate representations generated by Deep Neural Networks (DNN) and to use that understanding/knowledge to improve them. During this three years period, I've interned at the Mila research lab in Montreal for one year and was a visiting scholar in the universities of South California, Rochester and Adelaide. Projects were developped mostly with Python, Pytorch and Pandas. The most relevant projects are:
* Matching CNN without priors about data. Published at [IEEE DSW 2018](arxiv.org/pdf/1802.09802)
* Increasing the robustness of DNNs. Colaboration with USC. [Arxiv only](arxiv.org/abs/1805.10133)
* Evaluating robustness of DNNs. Colaboration with Mila and USC. Published at [IEEE DSW 2019](arxiv.org/abs/1909.05095)
* Improving visual based localization using graphs. Colaboration with University of Adelaide. Submitted to ICRA 2020)
* Neural network compression with graph distillation. Colaboration with Mila and USC, Submitted to ICASSP 2020)}
