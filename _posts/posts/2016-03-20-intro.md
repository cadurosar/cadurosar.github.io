Well, who am I and what is this thing anyway? I'm a horrible writer(words too complicated me can't with them), video-game aficionado, developer and proud supporter of Coritiba F.C.

Ok now that you know who am I, what the hell is this? This is me trying to get better at writing by trying to explain some cool stuff that I find or code. This will also serve so that I finally create a personal webpage for me.

The first posts of this blog should be me trying to generate a dataset to try to predict soccer results, wish me luck :)
